Welcome to the software engineering performance innovative task from the Computer Science program at USTP CDO. This project showcases your skills and knowledge in building a web application, following best practices, and structuring the project effectively.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
C:.
├── 📄 index.html
├── 📄 README.md
└── 🔧 assets
    ├── 🎨 css
    │   └── 🖌️ style.css
    ├── 🖼️ images
    │   ├── 👤 avatar.png
    │   └── 🖍️ favicon.png
    └── 💻 js
        └── 📝 main.js
```

## 📄 Files Overview

### Root Directory
- **index.html**  
  The main HTML file for your project.

- **README.md**  
  This file provides an overview of the project structure.

### 📂 Assets Folder

#### 🎨 CSS
- **style.css**  
  Contains the project's styling rules.

#### 🖼️ Images
- **avatar.png**  
  A placeholder or user avatar image.  
- **favicon.png**  
  The favicon for your website.

#### 💻 JavaScript
- **main.js**  
  Contains the JavaScript code for interactivity.

## 🌟 Get Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the webpage.
2. Edit files in the `assets` folder to customize the project:
   - Update styles in `style.css`.
   - Replace or add images in the `images` folder.
   - Add interactivity with `main.js`.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Run Locally**  
   - Ensure you have a web browser installed (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser by either double-clicking on it or using the `Open File` option in your browser.

2. **Run in a Development Environment (Optional)**  
   - You can use a local server for development to ensure that paths to files like images and stylesheets are correctly handled.
   - If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, you can use a simple HTTP server by running the following commands in your project directory:
     ```bash
     npx http-server
     ```
   - This will start a server on `http://localhost:8080` where you can view the project.
